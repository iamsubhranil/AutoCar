# each tile will have entry and exit points, and for each pair of entry-exit point combinations, it will have a net displacement associated with it. since the map is unidirectional, we're going to note down only entry exit points. our program will select the most appropriate one at runtime.
# 1 denotes left, 2 denotes right, 3 denotes up, 4 denotes down
# 0 denotes we're ignoring the tile for now
